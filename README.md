# UX

** Wireframes
When creating the initial design for the site, I used Figma to layout all the pages.

Various alterations were made throughout the process including footer changes, slight layout differences and colours used.

### Aim
* Create a site which allows Retro F.C. to create sales online for their football kits
* Create a site which easily allows users to navigate and purchase products without disruption to the process

### Design
Colour scheme was kept minimalistic to match the tone of the site, colours used were:
* Black (#000000)
* White (#FFFFFF)

** Typography
2 [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) were used across the site:
* Poppins
* Roboto Slab
