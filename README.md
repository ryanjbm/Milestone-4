# UX

**Wireframes**

When creating the initial design for the site, I used Figma to layout all the pages.

Various alterations were made throughout the process including footer changes, slight layout differences and colours used.

### Aim
* Create a site which allows Retro F.C. to create sales online for their football kits
* Create a site which easily allows users to navigate and purchase products without disruption to the process

### Design
Colour scheme was kept minimalistic to match the tone of the site, colours used were:
* Black (#000000)
* White (#FFFFFF)

**Typography**

2 [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) were used across the site:
* Poppins
* Roboto Slab

**Media**

All images were copyright free found using google images uploaded from other online stores. Logo created by myself on Canva.


# Features

### Navbar

<img src="media/navbar.png">

* The navigation bar appears on every page, it includes the company logo and name in the top left corner, also acting as a link back to the home page. Navigation links go across the middle of the navigation bar with one drop down allowing easy categorising of products
* On smaller resolutions the navbar collapses and the links go to a collapsible menu on the top left, the company logo dissapears to then allow quick access to the search bar, account and bag buttons
* When logged in users are unable to click the register button on the navbar
* When logged in as a superuser, you are given an extra option under account for product management

### Footer
* The footer features copyright information along with a shortcut button to register on the site

### Individual Pages

### Home

* Hero image with a dark gradient over the top so text is more visible
* A "Shop Now" button allowing quick access to viewing all the products
* Text about who and what Retro F.C. is and does
* Advertising of the Retro F.C. store featuring a button which opens up google maps in a new page with the coordinates for the store
